## Project Overview
This project explores the working principles behind **Blockchain-based Decentralized VPNs (dVPNs)** - secure, peer-to-peer networks where users share bandwidth and route encrypted traffic without relying on centralized servers.  

To understand and build towards this idea, the project is divided into **multiple tasks**, each focusing on key layers of network communication, traffic analysis, and protocol simulation.

##  Why This Matters
Decentralized VPNs depend on deep integration of **network routing**, **encryption**, and **protocol understanding**.  
These tasks helped visualize how:
- Packets are transmitted and secured,  
- IPs and domain names are resolved, and  
- Connections are established reliably between nodes.

This understanding forms the base for implementing decentralized, blockchain-backed, and privacy-preserving networking systems.

 Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of **TCP/IP, DNS, TLS**, and **network packet flow**.  
- Experience in using **Wireshark**, **DevTools**, and **Python network simulations**.  
- Insight into how **VPNs** (and by extension, **dVPNs**) maintain security and anonymity by encrypting and rerouting traffic.
